        <h1>The World's Major Large Cats</h1>
    
        <div class="cat">
            <h2>Lion (Panthera leo)</h2>
            <img src="/images/lion.webp" alt="Majestic lion roaming in the wild">
            <p>The lion, a magnificent and powerful feline, ranks among the largest members of the big cat family. Often referred to as the "King of the Jungle," this iconic species predominantly inhabits expansive grasslands, savannas, and open plains rather than dense forests. Male lions are particularly distinguished by their striking, thick manes, which vary in color from light blonde to deep brown and serve as a symbol of strength and maturity.</p>
            <p>Unlike other felines, lions exhibit a unique social structure, being the only truly social cats in the wild. They organize themselves into groups known as prides, which typically consist of several related females, their dependent cubs, and a coalition of one to four adult males who protect the group. This cooperative lifestyle enhances their hunting efficiency and territorial defense. As apex predators at the top of the food chain, lions primarily prey on large ungulates such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo, employing teamwork to take down their quarry.</p>
            <p>In the modern era, wild lion populations are mostly confined to sub-Saharan Africa, with a critically small and isolated population persisting in India’s Gir Forest National Park. Once widespread across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe and Asia, their range has significantly diminished over time. Lions are currently classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, facing numerous threats including habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and declining prey availability. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these regal animals and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Tiger (Panthera tigris)</h2>
            <img src="/images/tiger.webp" alt="Tiger in its natural habitat">
            <p>The tiger, a majestic and powerful predator, holds the distinction of being the largest member of the cat family. Adult male tigers can grow to impressive sizes, with some individuals tipping the scales at up to 660 pounds (300 kilograms) and measuring over 10 feet (3 meters) in length from nose to tail tip. Their striking appearance is characterized by a vibrant orange coat adorned with bold, black vertical stripes, which serves as excellent camouflage amidst the dappled light and shadows of their forest environments.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the social nature of lions, tigers are solitary creatures, preferring to hunt and live alone. These stealthy felines are masters of ambush, silently stalking their prey through dense vegetation before launching a swift and deadly attack. Their diet is diverse, primarily consisting of ungulates such as deer, wild boar, and antelope, but they are also capable of taking down larger quarry like water buffalo or even juvenile elephants when the opportunity arises. Remarkably, each tiger boasts a unique stripe pattern, much like a human fingerprint, allowing researchers to identify individual animals in the wild.</p>
            <p>Tragically, tigers are classified as an endangered species, with their numbers dwindling to a mere estimated population of 3,900 individuals in the wild as of recent surveys. These iconic cats now survive in fragmented habitats scattered across the Asian continent, including parts of India, Southeast Asia, and the Russian Far East. This represents a staggering loss of 93% of their historic range, which once stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Indonesian islands. The primary threats to their survival are relentless poaching for their bones, skin, and other body parts—driven by illegal wildlife trade—and the rapid destruction of their forest habitats due to human activities such as logging, agriculture, and urban expansion. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent animals, but their future remains precarious without sustained global action.</p>

            <h2>Jaguar (Panthera onca)</h2>
            <img src="/images/jaguar.webp" alt="Jaguar prowling through the dense rainforest">
            <p>The jaguar, a majestic and formidable feline, holds the title of the largest cat species in the Americas and ranks as the third largest in the world, surpassed only by lions and tigers. Renowned for their extraordinary bite strength, jaguars possess a unique hunting ability that sets them apart from other big cats. Their powerful jaws can crush the skulls of prey with ease and even shatter the tough, armored shells of turtles, showcasing their status as apex predators.</p>
            <p>Jaguars are adorned with a stunning golden-yellow coat, decorated with distinctive black rosettes that often encircle smaller spots, creating a mesmerizing pattern. These elusive cats are remarkably adaptable, thriving in a variety of environments. They are exceptional swimmers, often hunting in rivers and wetlands, and skilled climbers, capable of scaling trees to ambush prey or rest in the canopy. From the dense, humid rainforests of the Amazon to the swampy marshlands and grassy plains, jaguars demonstrate their versatility across diverse habitats.</p>
            <p>Historically, these awe-inspiring cats roamed a vast territory stretching from the southwestern United States through Central America and down to the southern reaches of Argentina. However, their range has drastically diminished over time due to human encroachment and environmental pressures. Today, jaguars are classified as near threatened on the conservation scale, facing significant challenges to their survival. Habitat fragmentation, driven by deforestation, agriculture, and urban development, poses the greatest threat to their populations, isolating groups and limiting their access to prey and mates. Efforts to protect these iconic creatures are critical to ensuring their continued presence in the wild.</p>

            <h2>Leopard (Panthera pardus)</h2>
            <img src="/images/leopard.jpg" alt="Leopard resting on a tree branch">
            <p>Leopards are renowned as the most versatile and adaptable members of the big cat family, thriving in an astonishing variety of environments, from arid deserts and rugged mountains to lush rainforests and grassy savannas. Their range spans vast regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East, and extends into Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. This remarkable adaptability is matched by their exceptional physical prowess—leopards possess incredible strength, capable of hoisting prey such as antelopes or deer, often weighing twice their own body mass, high into the branches of trees. This behavior not only showcases their power but also protects their meals from scavengers like hyenas and lions.</p>
            <p>The leopard’s distinctive coat is a masterpiece of natural design, featuring a tawny or yellowish background adorned with intricate black rosettes. These markings serve as superb camouflage, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, whether stalking through tall grass or lurking in dappled forest light. Unlike the jaguar, a close relative with a similar pattern, leopard rosettes are typically smaller and lack the central spots found in jaguar markings. Leopards are predominantly nocturnal, relying on their keen senses of sight and hearing to hunt under the cover of darkness. They are solitary by nature, with individuals maintaining well-defined territories that they mark and defend fiercely, only coming together briefly during mating season.</p>           
            <p>Despite their resilience and wide distribution, leopards face significant threats that have led to their classification as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. Nine subspecies are currently recognized, each adapted to its unique environment, from the robust African leopard to the elusive Javan leopard. Among them, the Amur leopard, native to the frigid forests of the Russian Far East and Northeast China, stands out as critically endangered. With fewer than 100 individuals left in the wild, this rare subspecies battles habitat loss, poaching, and a dwindling prey base. Conservation efforts are underway globally to protect these majestic cats, but challenges like deforestation, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal hunting continue to imperil their future.</p>

            <h2>Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia)</h2>
            <img src="/images/snow-leopard.jpg" alt="Snow leopard in a mountainous landscape">
            <p>The snow leopard, a majestic and elusive big cat, thrives in the rugged, cold, and mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including the Himalayas, the Altai Mountains, and the Tibetan Plateau. Their remarkable adaptations, such as dense, woolly fur, broad and furry paws, and an exceptionally long, bushy tail, enable them to endure freezing temperatures and traverse steep, snow-covered slopes with agility and grace.</p>
            <p>These solitary felines are adorned with stunning pale gray or yellowish coats, intricately patterned with dark rosettes and spots. This natural camouflage allows them to blend seamlessly into their rocky, snowy habitats, making them nearly invisible to both prey and predators. Snow leopards are skilled hunters, preying primarily on mountain goats, blue sheep (bharal), and smaller mammals like marmots and hares, often stalking their targets with stealth before launching powerful, precise attacks.</p>
            <p>Despite their awe-inspiring presence, snow leopards are classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Current estimates suggest that only 4,000 to 6,500 individuals remain in the wild, though their secretive nature makes precise counts challenging. They face numerous threats, including poaching for their luxurious pelts and bones, habitat loss due to climate change, and human-wildlife conflict, as herders sometimes kill them to protect livestock. Conservation efforts, such as anti-poaching patrols and community-based programs, are critical to ensuring the survival of this iconic species.</p>

        <div class="cat">
            <h2>Puma (Puma concolor)</h2>
            <img src="/images/puma.jpg" alt="Puma in a rocky landscape">
            <p>The puma, scientifically classified as Puma concolor, is a remarkable feline species commonly referred to as a cougar, mountain lion, or panther. This adaptable predator boasts the most extensive range of any wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere, with its habitat stretching from the frigid forests of Canada all the way down to the rugged southern Andes in South America. In terms of size, pumas rank as the second-largest cats in the Americas, surpassed only by the formidable jaguar.</p>
            <p>Adult pumas are characterized by their sleek, unspotted coats, which typically display a uniform tan or brownish-gray hue, providing excellent camouflage in their diverse environments. These solitary hunters are renowned for their extraordinary athletic prowess. With powerful hind legs, they can leap an astonishing 18 feet vertically into trees or across rocky terrain and cover distances of up to 40 feet in a single horizontal bound. Their primary prey consists of deer, such as mule deer or white-tailed deer, though their opportunistic nature allows them to take down a wide variety of animals, ranging from small rodents and birds to larger ungulates like elk or even livestock when wild prey is scarce.</p>
            <p>Despite their adaptability and wide distribution, pumas face significant challenges in the modern world. Globally, the species is not classified as endangered, earning a "Least Concern" status from the IUCN due to its broad range and population resilience. However, specific subspecies tell a different story. The Florida panther, a distinct population of pumas found in the southeastern United States, is critically endangered, with only a small number remaining in the wild. Threats to puma populations include habitat fragmentation caused by urban development, roads, and agriculture, as well as direct human-wildlife conflict, such as retaliatory killings by ranchers protecting livestock. Conservation efforts, including wildlife corridors and protected areas, are vital to ensuring the survival of these majestic cats, particularly in regions where their numbers are dwindling.</p>

            <h2>Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)</h2>
            <img src="/images/cheetah.jpg" alt="Cheetah on the savanna">
            <p>The cheetah, renowned as the fastest land animal on Earth, can achieve breathtaking speeds of up to 70 miles per hour in short, explosive bursts, making it an unparalleled sprinter among wildlife. Unlike its fellow big cats such as lions or tigers, the cheetah lacks the ability to roar. Instead, it communicates through a variety of unique vocalizations, including high-pitched chirps, purrs, and even a stuttering sound, which sets it apart in the feline family.</p>
            <p>Built for speed, the cheetah boasts a sleek, aerodynamic physique characterized by a slender frame, elongated legs, and specialized semi-retractable claws that provide exceptional grip during high-speed chases. Its coat, adorned with a pattern of solid black spots, aids in camouflage across the grassy plains. Perhaps most striking are the cheetah’s iconic black "tear marks," which stretch from the inner corners of its eyes down to its mouth. These markings are believed to serve a practical purpose, reducing the sun’s glare and enhancing focus while hunting under the bright African sky.</p>
            <p>Despite its remarkable adaptations, the cheetah is classified as a vulnerable species, with an estimated population of just 7,000 individuals left in the wild. The majority of these majestic animals roam the savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa, though a tiny, isolated group persists in Iran, known as the Asiatic cheetah. Their survival is jeopardized by numerous challenges, including habitat destruction due to human encroachment, conflicts with farmers protecting livestock, and a tragically high cub mortality rate—often exacerbated by predation from larger carnivores like lions and hyenas. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this extraordinary species, but its future remains uncertain.</p>
